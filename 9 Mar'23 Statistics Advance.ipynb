    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that assigns probabilities to the possible values of a discrete random variable1. For example, if we have a random variable X that represents the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die, then the possible values of X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The PMF of X would assign a probability of 1/6 to each of these possible values2.\n",

    "On the other hand, the Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
